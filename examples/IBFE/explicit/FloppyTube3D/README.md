# In this example, flow through a floppy tube is simualted based on ex7.
The "main.cpp" will read "tube.msh" which is generated by Gmsh.
Here is my workflow:
1. generate a geometry in FreeCAD and export it as .step;
2. a. open .step in gmsh
    b. add surface and volume in Modules->Geometry->Physical groups->Add
    (This step is necessary. Because it will tell gmsh only export .msh with surface and volume elements. Because currently libmesh:gmsh_io can just deal with 2d and/or 3d element, which is described in gmsh_io.C, line 469)
    c. generate mesh
    d. nodes coordinates is dimensionless. One have to scale it manually.(I think how gmsh_io read those nodes varies with libmesh versions. I am bit confused that sometime I have to convert the nodes coordinates while sometime I don't )
